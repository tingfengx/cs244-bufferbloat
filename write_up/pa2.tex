\section*{Abstract} 
Bufferbloat refers to the existence of excessively large and frequently full buffers inside a network. \cite{sivov12} 

Most TCP congestion control algorithms rely on packet drops to determine the available bandwidth between two ends of a connection.\cite{allman09, sayad11} In general, TCP congestion control algorithms speed up the data transfer (via increasing congestion window size) until packets start to drop, then slow down the transmission rate. Under ideal conditions, we expect an equilibrium speed to be reached after a period of time of adjustments.

In a fast to slow transition hop, bufferbloat can easily occur. Let's consider the internet topology illustrated in the assignment handout (Assignment Topology). TCP will continue to increase the cwnd size since packets sent out are being buffered inside the intermediate router $s_0$ and with no packet being dropped. It will only decrease the cwnd size when buffer of $s_0$ is saturated, but that is already too late. In other words, the buffer in the intermediate router has turned the packet drops into an \textbf{un-timely} indication of congestion, which is bad since TCP rely on timely communication of congestion via packet drops. 

Bufferbloat causes increase in queueing delay, and thus causes end users to experience increase in latency, which is the sum of transmission delay, processing delay, and queueing delay. \cite{sivov12} Bufferbloat also causes jitters and decreases the overall throughput of the network. 
\section*{Methods} 
We emulate our Assignment Topology using mininet. Then, we simultaneously perform the following three tasks
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
	\item start a long lived TCP flow sending data from $h_1$ to $h_2$, and
	\item send 1 ping per 0.1 second from $h_1$ to $h_2$, and 
	\item spawn an web server on $h_1$, and download the webpage from $h_1$ once every two seconds. 
\end{itemize}
This simulation is repeated for three different queue sizes, $Q = 5 / 20 / 100 $ pkts. Then, for each max queue size, we plot the time-series of the long-lived TCP flow's cwnd, the RTT reported by ping, the webpage download time, and the queue size at the router $s_0$. 

\section*{Results}
Table \ref{tab:mean and std} provides an summary of mean and standard deviation of the fetch time in all three experiments with queue size 5, 20, and 100 pkts respectively, while Figures \ref{fig:buffer5}, \ref{fig:buffer20} and \ref{fig:buffer100} are plotted time-series for the long lived TCP flow's cwnd, RTT reported by ping, webpage fetch time, and queue size at the router.

\section*{Discussion}
Although the buffer is designed to smooth bursts out, it can hurt to have a buffer that is too large just the same as having a too small buffer. We illustrate this with the results we described in the ``Results'' section. When the queue size is 5, since the buffer is too small, packets get dropped frequently, and this is causing both a high delay and a high variance in this case. On the contrary when the max queue size is 100, the buffer size is too big, and this is causing bufferbloat to happen. Figure \ref{fig:buffer100q} illustrates that this big buffer is frequently (unnecessarily) full and seldomly empty, indicating the bufferbloat problem is occurring. When the max buffer size is 20, however, the buffer is neither too big nor too small; we see the lowest mean fetch time and standard deviation in all three experiments in this case. 

Ipconfig reports a maximum queue length of \texttt{txqueuelen:1000} packets, and a MTU of 1500 bytes. Then, if we have a saturated buffer, we need
\begin{equation}
	(1000 \times 1500 \times 8) / (100 \times 10^6) = 0.12\, \mathrm{second}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:rtt q relationship} shows\footnote{This plot is generated with my script \texttt{plot\_relationship.py} available in the same directory as all the other plot python files. It is also automatically invoked in my modified version of \texttt{run.sh} script. You will need NumPy and Scipy.stats to run this script, I used them for the fitting of linear regression model.} the three data points that we have, which are pairs of queue size and the average RTT time taken reported by ping. On the plot, the coordinates are marked as text next to the data points. We than fit a linear regression model to our three data points, and then the fitted line is plotted on the same plot. We have reason to believe, with some allowance for error, that the relationship is linear and can be described as
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{RTT (ms)} = 2 \times \mathrm{queue Size}
\end{equation}

For the sake of mitigating the bufferbloat problem, we can try 
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
	\item The probably simplest approach is to decrease the buffer sizes at each hop. This way, when congestion happen, buffers fill up quickly, and then rely on packet drops as a timely indication of congestion. This approach is, however, not optimal. We originally introduced buffers to deal with bursts of packets, and make networking more smooth in general. Reducing buffer size will cost us the ability to deal with bursts in the network. 
	\item Use a delay based congestion avoidance algorithm rather than packet drop based. \cite{sivov12} In this way, if the delay is too high we know that the packet might have been buffered somewhere, signalling a congestion. We can then control the cwnd size based on this information
\end{itemize}
